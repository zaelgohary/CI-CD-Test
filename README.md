# Grid Weblets

![Version: 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/threefoldtech/grid_weblets?style=flat-square)

A svelte project for creating web components - which are reusable custom elements with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of the code â€” that interact with TF Grid 3 and could be utilized from other web apps.
It solves such problem where you had to write complex HTML (and associated style and script) to render custom UI controls (eg, to deploy some workload on the TF Grid 3), and how using them multiple times in different projects can be a miss if you are not careful.

To Try the project locally you can easy clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn deps
yarn serve:app
```
